# Online quiz

## Introduction
This application is intended to help mentors/teachers and students with online knowledge verification. It will provide the possibility to create different kinds of tests for many purposes like surveys, polls, tests, etc. The student will attend a test created by his mentor to pass it, he will be able to view his score and the teacher's evaluation with explanations if needed. Being online, the students will be able to chat with their mentors within a  test to get clarifications.

## Why online quiz platform?
In nowadays, remote learning became a more necessary condition. The digitalization process is growing constantly and the education domain also has its own benefits from it. Within this platform, teachers will be able to assess the progress of their students on different topics. During tests events, students will be in touch with their mentors through a chat system meant to help students and teachers contact each other more easily regarding the current test.
